Hi, I’m @lancegoyke 👋

Most of my life has been spent as a personal trainer 💪, but **I'm looking for careers in software engineering** 👨‍💻. If I might be a good fit for a role on your team, [I'd love to chat.](mailto:lance@lancegoyke.com)

I’ve been interested in software engineering all my life, starting with HTML back in the '90s. Since 2016, I've been teaching myself web development with *Django* and *Python*, though I've been dabbling in *htmx*, *JavaScript*, and *React*.
