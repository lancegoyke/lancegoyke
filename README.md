Hi, I’m @lancegoyke 👋

Most of my life has been spent as a personal trainer 💪.

I’ve been interested in software engineering all my life, starting with HTML back in the '90s. Since 2016, I've been teaching myself web development with *Django* and *Python*, though I've been dabbling in *htmx*, *JavaScript*, *React*, and *Rust*.

My most recent work is on [CopientAI](https://copient.ai/) (AI-powered sales training).
