Hi, Iâ€™m @lancegoyke ðŸ‘‹

Most of my life is spent as a **personal trainer** ðŸ’ª

Iâ€™ve been interested in software engineering all my life, starting with HTML back in the '90s. Since 2016, I've been teaching myself **web development** with *Django* and *Python*, though I've been dabbling in *htmx*, *JavaScript*, and *React*.
